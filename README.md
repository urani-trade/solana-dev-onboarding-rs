# 👩🏽‍💻 Solana Development Onboarding

<br>

### Our development resources, aiming to onboard engineers to Solana development. From geeks to geeks.

<br>

## 🛹 Why Solana?

<br>

Compared to older platforms like Bitcoin and EVM-based protocols, Solana is:

- **Massively cheaper**, as transaction fees are a small fraction of a penny.

- **Massively faster**, as most transactions are completed in a couple of seconds.

- **Highly decentralized**, having one of the highest Nakamoto coefficients (decentralization score) of any proof-of-stake network.

- **Fun AF**, with an uncomparable UI/UX and developer experience.
