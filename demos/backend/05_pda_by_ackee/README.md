# 🛹 Demo 5: Ackee's X Example 
#### (Mia's Solution)

<br>

A classical exercise for folks to learn PDAs in practice is Ackee's X App example: a program that can perform basic functions like:

* **creating tweets**, including a topic up to `32 bytes` and a content up to `500 bytes`. The topic is the seed for the PDA for this PDA (so users can have more than one tweet).
* **adding/removing tweet reactions**, covered by a new reaction account and PDA. In this case, the seeds for this PDA are chose to prevent more than one reaction per user on a tweet.
* **adding/removing tweet comments**, including a content field (`500 bytes`) that stores the text and is used as input into the comment account PDA.
